I am a Learning Scientist working at the intersection of learning sciences, generative AI, and educational technology. My work combines learning-centered research with user experience research (UXR) methods—such as interviews, usability testing, and mixed-methods evaluation—to design, evaluate, and improve AI-enabled learning tools across academic and industry contexts.

### Focus areas
- Human-centered GenAI for writing, feedback, and assessment
- Learning Design & educational technology evaluation
- Mixed-methods research: qualitative depth + quantitative signal
- Learning analytics and evidence-based product decision-making

### Now
- Research and evaluation of GenAI-enabled feedback systems in higher education
- Applied UXR on learning-related product experiences (prototypes → recommendations)
- Platform work on AI-supported writing and learning workflows (CyberScholar / CGScholar)
